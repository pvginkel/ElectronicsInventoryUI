### 1) Summary & Decision
Detail and form shells now share `DetailScreenLayout`/`FormScreenLayout`, and both parts and boxes adopt the new structure with instrumentation-friendly IDs. Playwright helpers/specs were updated to exercise the new surfaces, and `PartForm` now cleanly plugs into a dedicated edit route. **Decision: GO** — no correctness blockers surfaced.

### 2) Conformance to Plan (with evidence)
- **Layout primitives hardened (plan.md:20-27)** — `DetailScreenLayout` now exposes per-screen test IDs plus toolbar/footer hooks, while `FormScreenLayout` keeps the card chrome with optional slots (`src/components/layout/detail-screen-layout.tsx:24-88`, `src/components/layout/form-screen-layout.tsx:16-83`).
- **Parts detail migration (plan.md:28-32)** — the read-only surface is wrapped in `DetailScreenLayout`, wiring breadcrumbs, actions, and instrumentation scopes as requested (`src/components/parts/part-details.tsx:145-214`, `src/components/parts/part-details.tsx:689-714`).
- **Dedicated part edit route & PartForm cleanup (plan.md:34-41)** — inline editing is gone; the new `/parts/$partId/edit` screen applies `FormScreenLayout`, and `PartForm` now renders through a `renderLayout` hook to share the template (`src/routes/parts/$partId/edit.tsx:23-49`, `src/components/parts/part-form.tsx:641-684`).
- **Boxes detail rollout (plan.md:42-47)** — boxes now compose `DetailScreenLayout` with scoped test IDs and instrumentation metadata, and the existing modal editor persists (`src/components/boxes/box-details.tsx:73-99`, `src/components/boxes/box-details.tsx:303-334`).
- **Playwright harness updates (plan.md:15-17,52-57)** — page objects target the new slots and specs assert pinned headers/footers where added (`tests/support/page-objects/parts-page.ts:118-215`, `tests/e2e/parts/part-crud.spec.ts:1-58`, `tests/support/page-objects/boxes-page.ts:95-169`, `tests/e2e/boxes/boxes-detail.spec.ts:17-77`).
- **Gap** — the plan called for emitting `sectionCounts` in the new `parts.detail` instrumentation payload (plan.md:30); current metadata omits those counts (`src/components/parts/part-details.tsx:145-167`). Consider follow-up if the counts remain required by downstream consumers.

### 3) Correctness — Findings (ranked)
None.

### 4) Over-Engineering & Refactoring Opportunities
Nothing notable — abstractions are aligned with the documented templates.

### 5) Style & Consistency
Code follows existing patterns (camelCase models, Tailwind spacing, shared instrumentation utils) and keeps comments lean; no inconsistencies worth flagging.

### 6) Tests & Deterministic Coverage (new/changed behavior only)
- **Parts edit screen pinned chrome** — covered via `tests/e2e/parts/part-crud.spec.ts:29-64`, asserting header/footer stability and waiting on `PartForm` instrumentation.
- **Boxes detail pinned header/actions** — validated in `tests/e2e/boxes/boxes-detail.spec.ts:17-77`, including instrumentation waits and scroll assertions.
- **Coverage gap** — the plan’s Playwright checklist item for “Parts detail fixed header/toolbars” is not yet represented; consider adding a scroll assertion akin to the boxes spec to avoid regressions.
- **Local verification** — `pnpm check` (eslint + type-check) completed successfully.

### 7) Adversarial Sweep
1. **Cancel delete vs. stale modal** — Verified `BoxDetails` exits early when the confirm dialog returns `false`, so accidental deletes remain blocked (`src/components/boxes/box-details.tsx:118-141`).  
2. **Instrumentation payload sanity** — Checked `boxes.detail` ready/error paths; messages fall back to API errors without throwing, so Playwright waits stay deterministic (`src/components/boxes/box-details.tsx:73-97`).  
3. **Form instrumentation races** — Confirmed `PartForm` defers `isOpen` until duplicate/edit data is ready, preventing premature open events during async hydration (`src/components/parts/part-form.tsx:90-114`, `src/components/parts/part-form.tsx:641-684`). No failures observed.

### 8) Invariants Checklist
| Invariant | Where enforced | How it could fail | Current protection | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Detail headers stay pinned while body scrolls | `DetailScreenLayout` | Additional nested scroll containers | Single `<main>` with `overflow-auto` and fixed header/toolbar | src/components/layout/detail-screen-layout.tsx:45-88 |
| Box deletion always requires confirmation | `BoxDetails.handleDeleteBox` | Missing early return on cancel | Guard checks both `box` presence and confirm result | src/components/boxes/box-details.tsx:118-141 |
| Part form instrumentation opens only when data ready | `PartForm` | Emitting events during loading states | `isFormReady` gates `useFormInstrumentation`’s `isOpen` flag | src/components/parts/part-form.tsx:90-107 |

### 9) Questions / Needs-Info
None.

### 10) Risks & Mitigations (top 3)
- **R1** — Missing `sectionCounts` in `parts.detail` metadata may limit future automation relying on those counts → Mitigation: confirm consumers and extend `getReadyMetadata` if needed.
- **R2** — Parts detail pinned-header behavior lacks explicit Playwright coverage → Mitigation: add a scroll assertion similar to the new boxes spec.
- **R3** — Broader rollout to other domains (documents, sellers) is still untracked → Mitigation: document any remaining screens per plan step 6 before future slices.

### 11) Confidence
High — reviewed the main surfaces, checked instrumentation wiring, and exercised lint/type checks locally without discovering defects.
