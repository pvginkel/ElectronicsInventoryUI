# Kit Feature Refinements – Plan Summary

## Overview
Polish kit list and detail views with functional and visual improvements.

## Scope
- Optimize kit list view to use batch queries for shopping list icons (like part list does)
- Remove "Refresh needed" label from shopping list indicator tooltips (functionality not implemented)
- Fix scrollbar bug on kit detail view where page-level scrollbar appears
- Move archive button from list card to detail screen ellipsis menu
- Add delete option to kit detail ellipsis menu
- Show unlink icon on shopping cart link chip only on hover/focus

## User Impact
More performant kit list view, cleaner UI with better action organization, fixed scrollbar behavior.

## Complexity
Medium – multiple independent improvements with clear requirements.
