# Documentation Update Feature - Technical Plan

## Brief Description

Update the frontend project documentation to create a comprehensive README.md with Claude Code branding, update the features.md file to reflect current implementation status, and add an MIT license file.

## Files to Create or Modify

### New Files to Create

1. **README.md**
   - Replace the existing minimal Vite template README
   - Add Claude Code ASCII art header as specified
   - Include project overview derived from docs/product_brief.md
   - Add technology stack details
   - Include build and deployment instructions
   - Add contributing guidelines
   - Include research project notice

2. **LICENSE**
   - Create MIT license file
   - Include standard MIT license text
   - Set copyright year to 2024

### Files to Modify

1. **docs/features.md**
   - Update implementation checkboxes based on current codebase state
   - Mark newly implemented features as completed:
     - Additional part fields (voltage ratings, dimensions, mounting type, package, pin count, pin pitch, series)
     - Document viewing capabilities that are implemented
     - AI assistant integration features that are working
   - Verify and update mobile optimization status
   - Ensure all feature statuses match actual implementation

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Research Current Implementation Status

1. Review src/components/parts/part-form.tsx to identify all implemented part fields
2. Check src/components/parts/ai-part-review-step.tsx for AI integration status
3. Examine src/components/documents/ for document viewing capabilities
4. Verify mobile-responsive features in UI components
5. Check src/routes/ for implemented features and pages

### Phase 2: Create README.md

1. Start with the specified Claude Code ASCII art
2. Add project title and tagline
3. Include "Built with Claude Code" badge/notice
4. Write project overview section:
   - Purpose: hobby electronics inventory management
   - Target audience: individual hobbyists
   - Key benefits from product brief
5. Add features section with link to docs/features.md
6. Document technology stack:
   - React 19 with TypeScript
   - TanStack Router and Query
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Vite build tooling
   - OpenAPI client generation
7. Write getting started section:
   - Prerequisites (Node.js, pnpm)
   - Backend requirement note
8. Add development setup:
   - Clone repository
   - Install dependencies (pnpm install)
   - Configure backend URL
   - Generate API client (pnpm generate:api)
   - Run development server (pnpm dev)
9. Document build and deployment:
   - Build command (pnpm build)
   - Preview command (pnpm preview)
   - Deployment considerations
10. Add contributing section:
    - Fork and PR process
    - Code standards reference to CLAUDE.md
    - Testing requirements (when implemented)
11. Include research project disclaimer
12. Add license reference

### Phase 3: Update features.md

1. Review each feature category against current implementation
2. Update Phase 1 checkboxes:
   - Part Management UI: mark additional fields as implemented
   - Document Viewing: update based on actual capabilities
   - AI Assistant Integration: mark implemented features
   - Mobile Optimization: verify responsive design status
3. Ensure consistency between claimed features and actual code
4. Add any newly implemented features not yet documented

### Phase 4: Create LICENSE file

1. Use standard MIT license template
2. Set copyright line: "Copyright (c) 2024"
3. Include full permission grant text
4. Add warranty disclaimer

## Implementation Notes

- The README should emphasize this was built with Claude Code as requested
- Features.md must accurately reflect the current state to avoid confusion
- The documentation should be concise and developer-focused
- Links between documentation files should use relative paths
- Maintain consistency with the backend README format where applicable
