# Code Review – Playwright Documents Real Backend

## Findings
- None outstanding – earlier medium issues about thumbnail verification and duplicated attachment helpers are now resolved in the follow-up fixes below.

## Questions / Follow-ups
- None.

## Summary
Plan implementation is now in line with expectations.

## Follow-up Fixes
- Ensured `DocumentGridPage.waitForPreviewImage` waits for the underlying `<img>` to fully load (non-zero `naturalWidth`) so real-backend thumbnail failures are caught by the spec (`tests/support/page-objects/document-grid-page.ts`).
- Updated the duplication spec to use `testData.parts.attachments.createBinary`, removing the bespoke FormData helper and keeping the flow on the shared factory (`tests/e2e/parts/part-duplication.spec.ts`).
