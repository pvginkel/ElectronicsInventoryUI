# List Refinements – Plan Summary

## Overview
Implement search debounce app-wide through a centralized, reusable component.

## Scope
- Refactor search debounce (introduced for kits) throughout the app by creating a reusable search component
- The solution must centralize the debounce logic, NOT duplicate it across multiple list components
- Preferably embed the search component in the list view template (ListScreenLayout) or create a standalone component that can be easily dropped into each list
- Apply to all list views: parts, boxes, sellers, shopping lists

## User Impact
Improved search performance across all list views with consistent behavior.

## Complexity
Medium – requires architectural consideration for:
- Creating a reusable component that manages debounced search state
- Integrating with URL-based search parameters (search must update URL query string)
- Maintaining browser back/forward compatibility
- Ensuring clear button bypasses debounce for instant feedback

## Key Architectural Requirement
The implementation MUST avoid duplicating search state management, useEffects, and handlers across multiple list components. All debounce logic should be centralized in a single reusable component or hook.
