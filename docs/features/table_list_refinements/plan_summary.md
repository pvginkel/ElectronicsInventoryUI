# Table and List Refinements – Plan Summary

## Overview
Fix table styling and implement search debounce app-wide.

## Scope
- Fix bottom rounded corners on pick list and kit detail view tables by removing bg-background class and using divide-y classes
- Refactor search debounce (introduced for kits) throughout the app, preferably by embedding it in the list view template

## User Impact
Consistent table styling with proper rounded corners. Improved search performance across all list views.

## Complexity
Medium – table fix is straightforward, search debounce requires architectural consideration for list view template integration.
