# Playwright Test Coverage Extension - Technical Plan

## Brief Description

Implementation of comprehensive end-to-end test coverage for the Electronics Inventory application, extending the existing Playwright test infrastructure to cover all core features and user workflows. The implementation will be executed in phases corresponding to functional areas, with each phase requiring complete test suite verification before proceeding.

## Implementation Phases

The test coverage extension will be implemented in 6 distinct phases, each focusing on a specific functional area. Each phase must be completed, tested, and signed off before proceeding to the next.

## Algorithms and Patterns

### Test-Event Capture Pattern
1. Hook into the Playwright binding for test-event emissions
2. Store events in a circular buffer with timestamp and metadata
3. Provide assertion helpers to validate event sequences
4. Clear buffer between test scenarios

### Toast Assertion Pattern
1. Monitor role="status" elements for toast notifications
2. Capture toast text, type (success/error/info), and timing
3. Provide fluent assertions for toast content and sequence
4. Handle toast auto-dismiss timing in assertions

### SSE Mock Pattern
1. Intercept EventSource connections
2. Simulate server-sent events with controlled timing
3. Test reconnection logic and heartbeat handling
4. Validate correlation IDs between frontend and mock events

### Factory Enhancement Pattern
1. Create domain object with minimal required fields
2. Add helper methods for common test scenarios (with stock, with documents)
3. Support override parameters for edge case testing
4. Return both created object and related entities for assertion

## AI Testing Specifics

The AI-assisted creation tests in Phase 3 should cover the following scenarios if implemented:

### Auto-tagging from Description/Manufacturer Code
- Test that entering a manufacturer code like "OMRON G5Q-1A4" generates appropriate tags (e.g., "relay", "5V", "SPDT")
- Test that descriptions like "0603 100nF ceramic capacitor" produce tags like "SMD", "0603", "100nF", "ceramic"
- Verify tag suggestions appear in real-time as the user types
- Test that users can accept, modify, or reject suggested tags
- Verify test-event emissions for AI tag generation (start, success, failure)

### Photo Intake (Mobile Camera)
- Mock file upload with sample component images
- Test that the AI recognizes part numbers from images (e.g., IC markings, label text)
- Verify category suggestions based on visual recognition
- Test fallback behavior when recognition confidence is low
- Verify user can override AI suggestions before saving

### Datasheet Auto-fetching
- Test that entering a known part number triggers datasheet search
- Mock external API responses for datasheet URLs
- Verify PDF is downloaded and attached to the part automatically
- Test user confirmation flow before storing fetched documents
- Handle cases where multiple datasheets are found or none are found
- Verify test-event payloads for datasheet fetch attempts and results

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Test AI service unavailability (graceful degradation)
- Test rate limiting scenarios
- Verify toast notifications for AI failures don't block manual entry
- Test that AI features can be disabled/skipped entirely
- Verify correlation IDs link AI requests to form submissions

### Instrumentation Requirements
Each AI interaction should emit test events with:
- `kind: 'ai'`
- `feature`: 'auto-tag' | 'photo-intake' | 'datasheet-fetch'
- `phase`: 'request' | 'success' | 'failure' | 'user-override'
- `correlationId`: linking to the parent form operation
- `metadata`: confidence scores, suggestion counts, processing time

## Execution Strategy

Each phase follows this execution pattern:

1. **Implementation**: Create/modify files according to phase requirements
2. **Test Execution**: Run full test suite with `pnpm playwright test`
3. **Debug & Fix**: Address any failures using `pnpm playwright test --debug`
4. **Documentation Update**: Mark completed items in `docs/epics/playwright_outstanding_work.md`
5. **Sign-off**: Obtain approval before proceeding to next phase

The phased approach ensures:
- Incremental progress with clear checkpoints
- Early detection of infrastructure issues
- Maintainable test suite growth
- Clear progress tracking through the outstanding work document
