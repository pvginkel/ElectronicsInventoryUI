**1) Summary & Decision**
Implementation delivers the Phase 1 shopping list polish: overview tabs persist via local storage, cards are fully clickable, destructive actions move into the detail header, and Playwright specs now exercise the revised flows. However, deleting a list from the detail view wipes whatever search filter the user had applied on the overview, which is a regression from the previous UX. **Decision:** `GO-WITH-CONDITIONS` — preserve the user’s active filter when navigating back after a deletion, and close the missing Playwright coverage for the new part-detail badge icon.

**2) Conformance to Plan (with evidence)**
- Tabs & persistence: `ShoppingListsOverview` now owns `activeTab` with a local-storage hydrator (`src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:34-58`) and emits the renamed `{ activeTab, activeCount, completedCount }` metadata (`src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:84-134`), matching plan items 2.2 & 2.5 (`docs/features/shopping_list_phase1/plan.md:26-29`).
- Card UX: Overview cards expose the whole surface as an interactive button with keyboard support and no inline actions (`src/components/shopping-lists/overview-card.tsx:70-138`), aligning with plan 2.7 (`docs/features/shopping_list_phase1/plan.md:31`).
- Delete-from-detail: Concept header injects a “Delete list” CTA and the route wires `useListDeleteConfirm` with a detail-specific dialog id (`src/components/shopping-lists/concept-header.tsx:200-236`, `src/routes/shopping-lists/$listId.tsx:115-148`), covering plan 3.1–3.2.
- Boxes navigation: Box cards are now a single clickable surface, and list state owns only view navigation (`src/components/boxes/box-card.tsx:1-74`, `src/components/boxes/box-list.tsx:3-118`), fulfilling plan 5.1–5.2.
- Deviations:
  - Overview summary still renders “Active/Completed shopping lists” despite plan 2.4 calling for generic “X shopping lists” copy (`docs/features/shopping_list_phase1/plan.md:28` vs `src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:229-233`).
  - Playwright change-set omits the badge-icon assertion promised by coverage item 4 (`docs/features/shopping_list_phase1/plan.md:56-61`); `tests/e2e/shopping-lists/parts-entrypoints.spec.ts:1-160` exercises badges but never checks for the new `<ShoppingCart />`.

**3) Correctness — Findings (ranked)**
- **[C1] Major — Deleting from detail clears the user’s search filter**  
  **Evidence:** `src/routes/shopping-lists/$listId.tsx:83-89` hard-codes `search: { search: '' }` when navigating back. Previously, deletion happened on the overview so filters stayed in place; now, if I filter to find a list, delete it, and return, the overview shows all lists again.  
  **Why it matters:** Users lose context after every delete, defeating the purpose of filtering to bulk clean up lists.  
  **Fix suggestion:** Carry the prior search value when navigating back (e.g., stash it in route state before opening detail, or read from `history` and reuse it) instead of resetting to an empty string.  
  **Confidence:** High (verified by tracing the navigation call and the absence of any state restoration).

**4) Over-Engineering & Refactoring Opportunities**
- None significant detected; the refactor extends existing hooks/components without introducing new abstraction layers.

**5) Style & Consistency**
- Line-count badges on overview cards still say “Done” (`src/components/shopping-lists/overview-card.tsx:144-153`), which jars with the plan-wide “Completed” terminology shift. Consider updating the badge label/tooltips for consistency.

**6) Tests & Deterministic Coverage (new/changed behavior only)**
- Scenario coverage: overview tab persistence (Playwright `keeps the completed tab active...`) and delete-from-detail are now exercised with `waitForUiState` / `waitForListLoading`, satisfying coverage items 1–3 & 5.
- Gap: Coverage item 4 (“assert each badge renders the shopping cart icon”) is still missing — no spec checks for the icon introduced in `part-details.tsx:277-284`. Adding a quick assertion such as `expect(parts.shoppingListBadgeByName(...).locator('svg')).toBeVisible()` would lock the visual contract.

**7) Adversarial Sweep**
- **[C1]** Filter → delete → return flow broke as detailed above.
- Attempted to break tab instrumentation by switching tabs during in-flight fetches; the `filterUiPendingRef` gate and `beginUiState` pairing (`src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:118-133`) ensured `endUiState` fires only once data settles — no stale events observed.
- Evaluated boxes flow for stale list state after detail edits; the list view simply navigates to detail and relies on existing query invalidation (`src/components/boxes/box-list.tsx:90-118`), so no duplicate mutation paths remained.

**8) Invariants Checklist**

| Invariant | Where enforced | How it could fail | Current protection | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tab selection persists across reloads | `src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:34-58` | Invalid localStorage value | Initializer clamps to `'active'` unless value is `'completed'`; effect rewrites guarded by `typeof window` | `src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:38-58` |
| Filter metadata matches rendered lists | `src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:84-105`, `223-233` | Divergence between instrumentation and UI | Both summary text and metadata derive from the shared `activeLists`/`completedLists` memos | `src/components/shopping-lists/overview-list.tsx:90-133` |
| Returning from delete preserves user context | `src/routes/shopping-lists/$listId.tsx:83-89` | Hard-coded navigation erases filters | No guard — we always navigate with `search: ''`, causing [C1] | `src/routes/shopping-lists/$listId.tsx:83-89` |

**9) Questions / Needs-Info**
- Q1: Should the overview summary follow plan copy (“X shopping lists” / “Y of X shopping lists”) instead of tab-specific text? Clarifying intent will tell us whether to adjust the string.

**10) Risks & Mitigations**
- R1 — Filter loss on delete frustrates cleanup workflows → Preserve the prior `search` parameter when navigating back.  
- R2 — Missing badge-icon test allows future regressions → Add a Playwright assertion that the `<ShoppingCart>` icon renders next to each membership badge.  
- R3 — Mixed “Done/Completed” terminology can confuse users → Update remaining “Done” strings on overview badges to “Completed”.

**11) Confidence**
Medium — The regression is reproducible via code inspection, and the untouched coverage item suggests more polish is pending, but the rest of the slice exercises realistic scenarios and instrumentation.
