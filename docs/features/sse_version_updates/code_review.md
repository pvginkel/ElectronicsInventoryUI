# SSE Version Updates - Code Review

## Summary
The SSE version updates implementation successfully replaces the polling-based system with Server-Sent Events. The code follows the plan closely but has several issues that need addressing.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Event Type Handling Bug in `use-version-sse.ts`
**Location:** `src/hooks/use-version-sse.ts:83-90`

The `onmessage` handler incorrectly checks `event.type` which will always be `"message"` for SSE events. This means the disconnect/reconnect logic for unexpected events will never trigger correctly.

**Current code:**
```typescript
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.type !== 'version' && event.type !== 'keepalive') {
    // This condition will always be true since event.type is "message"
    disconnect();
    scheduleReconnect();
  }
};
```

**Issue:** The code should be checking the event name, not using `onmessage`. Since `version` and `keepalive` are handled via `addEventListener`, unexpected events should be caught differently. The current implementation would disconnect on every message.

### 2. Incomplete Cleanup - version.json Still Generated
**Location:** `vite.config.ts:30-37`

The build process still generates `version.json` file even though it's no longer used. This creates unnecessary confusion and should be removed.

## Moderate Issues

### 3. Missing Error Boundaries
The SSE connection errors are only logged to console. While the plan mentions "silent failures", there's no user feedback mechanism if the connection persistently fails.

### 4. Race Condition in Initial Version Setting
**Location:** `src/contexts/deployment-context.tsx:37-44`

If the SSE connection delivers multiple version events quickly on initial connection, there's a potential race condition where `currentVersion` might not be set correctly due to React state batching.

### 5. Memory Leak Risk on Rapid Reconnects
**Location:** `src/hooks/use-version-sse.ts:48-57`

The `scheduleReconnect` function doesn't check if a reconnect is already scheduled before setting a new timeout, potentially creating multiple overlapping timeouts.

## Minor Issues

### 6. Inconsistent Error Handling Pattern
The hook sets an error state but the deployment context doesn't use it. The error is effectively ignored, which might be intentional but creates unused code.

### 7. Development Mode Behavior
The SSE connection is active in development mode as planned, but this might cause unnecessary console errors during development when the backend isn't running.

## Positive Aspects

✅ **Clean Hook Architecture:** The `useVersionSSE` hook is well-structured and follows React best practices.

✅ **Proper Cleanup:** Component unmounting properly cleans up connections and timeouts.

✅ **Exponential Backoff:** Reconnection strategy correctly implements exponential backoff with a 60s cap.

✅ **Context Integration:** The deployment context cleanly integrates the SSE hook and maintains backward compatibility with the notification bar.

✅ **Pattern Consistency:** The code follows the existing pattern from `use-sse-task.ts` appropriately.

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
1. Fix the event type checking bug in `use-version-sse.ts` - remove the `onmessage` handler entirely since all valid events are handled via `addEventListener`.
2. Remove version.json generation from `vite.config.ts`.

### Should Fix
3. Add a check in `scheduleReconnect` to clear existing timeout before setting a new one.
4. Consider adding a maximum connection failure count with user notification after N failures.

### Nice to Have
5. Add a debug flag or environment check to disable SSE in development mode if desired.
6. Consider removing the unused error state from the hook or using it in the context.

## Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is generally solid and follows the plan well. The code is clean, well-typed, and follows project conventions. The main issues are correctness bugs rather than architectural problems. Once the event handling bug is fixed, this should work reliably in production.
