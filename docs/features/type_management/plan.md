   - Preview of how type appears in selectors

2. **Create type-validation.ts** - Robust validation system:
   - Name uniqueness checking (case-insensitive)
   - Reserved word protection
   - Character limit and format validation
   - Dependency checking (parts using this type)
   - Migration path validation for changes

3. **Create use-type-management hook** - Centralized operations:
   - CRUD operations with validation
   - Bulk operations with progress tracking
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Change impact analysis

### Phase 3: Type Analytics and Insights
1. **Create type-analytics.ts** - Usage analysis utilities:
   - Calculate usage statistics and trends
   - Identify orphaned/unused types
   - Analyze type popularity over time
   - Generate usage recommendations
   - Performance impact analysis

2. **Create TypeUsageChart component** - Visual analytics:
   - Bar chart of most/least used types
   - Usage trend over time
   - Distribution by category
   - Interactive drill-down capabilities
   - Export analytics data

3. **Create TypeMetrics component** - Key performance indicators:
   - Total types count and growth
   - Average parts per type
   - Category distribution
   - Cleanup recommendations
   - System health indicators

### Phase 4: Bulk Operations and Data Management
1. **Create BulkTypeActions component** - Multi-type operations:
   - Delete multiple types with dependency checking
   - Bulk rename with pattern matching
   - Category assignment for multiple types
   - Export selected types to file
   - Bulk location suggestion updates

2. **Create TypeMergeDialog** - Intelligent type consolidation:
   - Detect similar/duplicate types
   - Preview merge impact on existing parts
   - Configurable merge strategies

   - Rollback capability for mistakes

3. **Create TypeDeleteDialog** - Safe deletion workflow:
   - Show all parts using the type before deletion
   - Offer migration to similar types
   - Cascade deletion warnings
   - Confirmation with type name entry
   - Undo window for accidental deletions

### Phase 5: Advanced Features and Templates

## Algorithms and Logic

### Type Similarity Detection Algorithm
```
findSimilarTypes(targetType, allTypes):
  1. Calculate string similarity (edit distance)
  2. Check for common abbreviations and expansions
  3. Analyze usage pattern similarity
  4. Consider category and description overlap
  5. Generate similarity score (0-1)
  6. Return ranked list of similar types
```

### Safe Type Deletion Workflow
```
validateTypeDeletion(typeId):
  1. Find all parts using this type
  2. Check for active stock in those parts
  3. Identify potential replacement types
  4. Calculate migration impact and effort
  5. Generate deletion safety report
  6. Return recommendations and warnings
```

### Bulk Type Operation Processing
```
processBulkTypeOperation(operation, typeIds, params):
  1. Validate operation permissions and constraints
  2. Calculate operation impact across all affected parts
  3. Generate execution plan with rollback points
  4. Execute operations in dependency-safe order
  5. Track progress and handle partial failures
  6. Provide detailed operation results
```

### Type Usage Analytics Calculation
```
calculateTypeAnalytics(types, parts, timeRange):
  1. Aggregate part counts by type
  2. Calculate stock quantities by type
  3. Analyze usage trends over time
  4. Identify growth and decline patterns
  5. Generate usage recommendations
  6. Return comprehensive analytics object
```
