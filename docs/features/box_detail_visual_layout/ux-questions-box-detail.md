# UX Discovery Questions: Box Detail View Redesign

## Current Usage & Context

1. **When do you typically access the box detail view?** Are you:
   - Not sure. Your suggestions make sense.

2. **How do you currently find boxes?** Do you:
   - I have 7 boxes at the moment. I don't expect many more. The boxes have a label on them with what's in it. I look for that in the UI.

## Part Identification & Information

3. **For unlabeled parts, what information DO you typically have?**
   - Nothing. It's just stuff in a location in a box. It's already in the system though so all information is there (a photo and the technical details).

4. **What's the most important information to see for each part at a glance?**
   - Primarily these:
      - Name/description?
      - Thumbnail image?
      - Quantity on hand?
      - Part number?

## Location Structure

5. **How do you think about locations within a box?**
   - Are they numbered/ordered in a specific way that matches physical reality? -> Left to right, top to bottom.
   - Do location names/codes have meaning (e.g., "A1", "Top-Left", "Drawer-1")? -> No. The boxes do though.
   - Is the spatial layout of locations relevant? -> I don't want to add this metadata to boxes. I appreciate a realistic visual layout would be nice, but I don't want it.

6. **For locations with many parts (like your 9-part location)**, what's most helpful:
   - I would like to see all of them. I don't want anything collapsed. I think a search option at the top of the screen would be good, but not at a location level. Don't group by type or category.

## Actions & Workflows

7. **What actions do you commonly want to take from this view?**
   - Click through to part details? -> Yes.
   - See where else a part is located? -> Don't hide parts.
   - Update quantities? -> No. The click through screen will handle that.
   - Move parts between locations? -> No. Same.
   - Print labels? -> No. Same.

8. **Device usage**: Are you using this primarily on desktop, or do you need good mobile/tablet support? (e.g., using a phone while standing at the physical box?)
   - Desktop.
