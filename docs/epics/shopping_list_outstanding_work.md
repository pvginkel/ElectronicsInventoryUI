Incomplete. Do not yet pick up.

- [ ] The whole card needs to be clickable. The delete button can move into the detail view, next to Edit Details.
- [ ] Edit and delete actions on lines must become icons on the line itself.
- [ ] Update Stock button is too small. The text wraps into two lines.
- [ ] I don't like the highlight color an edited line gets.
- [ ] When new: the Edit line menu option can become a pencil and the Mark as Ordered can become a button same as Update Stock. Remove the menu.
- [ ] When ordered: the pencil next to ordered quantity duplicates the Adjust ordered quantity menu item. The latter can be removed. The single Edit line menu option can become a pencil and the menu can be removed.
- [ ] When done: just the pencil. It's the only menu option.
- [ ] Center align the status column.
- [ ] Rework order note. Make it two lines height by default (it's four now) and grow it to max 5 lines if the content is too much for it. Hide the x/x characters label and buttons. When the content becomes dirty, show a floating save/cancel button panel that overlays the form and is sticky to the bottom right of the text box. Prefer to make it a check and cross button. It's like the icons you get when you do inline edit in Jira.
- [ ] The Receive now field in the Update stock screen is unnecessary. It needs to be inferred from the amounts entered into Allocate to location fields.
