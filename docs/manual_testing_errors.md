- ‚úÖ **Parts breadcrumb** - Added breadcrumb bar to parts screen matching storage screen

### Create part:

- ‚úÖ **UI layout matching** - Updated part screen to match box screen with multi-column layout, breadcrumbs, consistent button styling, and added "Delete Part" button

### Part list:

- ‚úÖ **Text corrections** - Changed "Manufacturer" to "Manufacturer Code" and "Total Qty" to "Total Quantity"  
- ‚úÖ **Search results** - Fixed "Add First Part" button to only show when there's no search term

### Storage box:

- ‚úÖ **Location row cleanup** - Removed redundant location name from location rows

## ‚è≥ BACKEND-DEPENDENT ISSUES

These issues require backend improvements that are currently in progress:

### Part list:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Total Quantity display** - Currently shows 0, needs backend to calculate and return actual total quantities

### Storage list:  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Usage calculation** - Storage usage not reflecting real data, needs backend to provide actual location usage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error handling** - Box deletion error messages (409 responses) need generic error handling implementation

### Part screen:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **404 error feedback** - Visual feedback for invalid box/location errors deferred pending backend error handling improvements

### Storage box:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Location information** - Location data not updating properly, likely needs backend data structure improvements
