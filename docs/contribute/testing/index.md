# Testing Overview

The Electronics Inventory frontend ships with a Playwright-based end-to-end suite that runs against the real backend. This overview introduces the architecture, philosophy, and folder layout before you dive into the detailed guides.

## Guiding Principles

1. **API-first data setup** – Tests create prerequisite data through API factories; the UI is only used for the behavior under test.
2. **Real backend always** – Specs must exercise the production backend endpoints directly; do not intercept or stub HTTP requests. The `testing/no-route-mocks` ESLint rule enforces this for all Playwright sources. If a scenario needs special behavior, extend the backend with test-friendly hooks instead of mocking—the *only* waiver lives alongside the shared AI analysis helper and documents its backend gap.
3. **Fresh data per test** – Every scenario seeds its own data via factories with randomized identifiers; never reuse records across tests.
4. **Dirty database friendly** – We do not care about accumulated test data. Databases are torn down between runs, so favor clarity over cleanup. If data volume exposes performance issues, treat that as a signal to optimize the backing service.
5. **Page objects over selector maps** – Each feature owns a page object colocated with its tests for readable UI interactions.
6. **No arbitrary waits** – Assertions rely on observable UI state or deterministic events; `waitForTimeout` is banned.
7. **Test-mode instrumentation** – Frontend emits structured test events only when `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`, and Playwright captures them via a dedicated bridge for deterministic assertions.

- **Wait Strategies**: See [No-Sleep Patterns](./no_sleep_patterns.md)

## Test Taxonomy

- `tests/e2e/types/*` – Types feature pilot coverage (CRUD, blocked delete)
- `tests/support/fixtures.ts` – Registers shared fixtures (`testData`, `types`, console guarding, test-event bridge)
- `tests/support/global-setup.ts` – Configures environment before the suite (sets `FRONTEND_URL`, etc.)

As additional features gain coverage, follow the same foldering: keep page objects next to their specs and reuse shared helpers from `tests/support`.

## Performance Guidelines

- Seed complex state through factories instead of long UI flows.
- Prefer specific assertions over broad waits to keep runs fast.
- Avoid duplicate coverage—exercise each backend path once per spec unless a regression requires more.
- Use parallel-safe random data (`prefix-shortId`) so reruns skip costly resets; never reuse data seeded by another test.

## Backend Responsibilities

- When a flow needs deterministic behavior (e.g., AI analysis responses, long-running jobs), add explicit testing hooks to the backend rather than stubbing network calls. For example, the AI analysis SSE endpoint should expose a test trigger that Playwright can seed via the API—for instance, POST a prebaked payload to a testing route and then issue a UI search for a sentinel such as `test-response-12345` to stream that payload back.
- If a feature cannot currently be exercised without interception, treat that as a backend gap. Before any Playwright work begins, add a **Blocking Issues** section at the top of the feature plan that calls out the missing backend support so it can be coordinated and resolved.

## Instrumentation & Signals

- The frontend emits structured test events through the Playwright bridge while in test mode.
- Tests use helpers such as `waitTestEvent` and `expectConsoleError` from `tests/support/helpers.ts`.
- Review [Test Instrumentation](../architecture/test_instrumentation.md) for the precise taxonomy (`route`, `form`, `api`, `toast`, `error`, `query_error`, `ui_state`, `list_loading`, `sse`).

## Next Steps

- Deep dive into the [Playwright Developer Guide](./playwright_developer_guide.md) for detailed workflows.
- When adding coverage, follow the [Add an E2E Test](../howto/add_e2e_test.md) checklist.
- For execution details (headless policy, managed services), see [CI & Execution](./ci_and_execution.md).
